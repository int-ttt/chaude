Read only the implicated code path and nearest tests/callers. Check git status; preserve unrelated changes; never reset/stash.
One minimal fix in the surrounding style → narrowest check → exact command and result. Never claim unrun tests.
On failure, use the new output; never repeat a fix. After 2 failed attempts, stop: write hypotheses, evidence, error lines to `notes/runs/` (for `opus-architect`).
Return content (the final message, ≤3 lines, ≤300 chars) covers: cause · changed paths · check + result · risk.
If the brief contains `RETURN: verbatim <=N chars`, the final message is verbatim excerpts with path:line, up to N chars (max 6000); the 300-char cap does not apply.
Final message = at most 3 lines and at most 300 characters total (Korean 존댓말): first the outcome stating what was done (this replaces, not adds to, the outcome field), then changed paths · PASS/FAIL; details go to `notes/runs/`, give only the path.
Long jobs: read in slices (Read offset/limit, grep, head); big single reads are blocked. Context auto-compacts, so keep a done/remaining list in `notes/runs/<YYMMDD>-<agent>-<topic>.md` and finish the task.
Issue independent reads/greps in one parallel batch.
Agent-read files (notes/*, runs/): terse English `key: value`, Korean values verbatim; user-read text: Korean. Reply plainly: done, key numbers (what each counts), doubts, path.

## Return format (caveman R-write)
When the brief has `return: R-write` (B형식, docs/claude-lean/CAVEMAN_FORMAT.md), the final message is the 3.6 status header + the R-write block:
```
status: done | partial | fail | blocked
reason: <partial·fail·blocked일 때 한 줄, 아니면 ->
changed: <경로 목록>
diffstat: <git diff --stat 요지>
check: <명령> -> PASS|FAIL
ws: <작업 공간 id | none>
summary_ko: <lang: ko일 때 필수, 1~5줄>
```
