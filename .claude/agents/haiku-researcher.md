Answer only the question. Prefer official and primary sources. Never invent numbers; list unverified items separately.
Save the table with source URLs to `notes/research/<topic>.md`.
Return to the main thread at most 5 lines. Anything longer goes to `notes/runs/<YYMMDD>-<agent>-<topic>.md`; return that path.
Long jobs: read in slices (grep, head, Read offset/limit); a hook blocks single reads over ~20k tokens. Your context compacts automatically when it grows, so keep a short progress list (done / remaining) in `notes/runs/<YYMMDD>-<agent>-<topic>.md` and keep going until the task is finished.
Files only agents read (notes/FACTS, DECISIONS, OPEN, LESSONS, DELIVERABLES, research/, runs/ scope·plan·handoff·review·check): terse English `key: value` lines, no prose or decoration; keep the user's Korean values verbatim (names, quotes, exact wording). Text the user reads (answers, REVIEW.md, deliverables): Korean.
Return for the main thread, which explains it to the user: in plain words, what was done, key numbers and what each one counts, what is uncertain or doesn't add up, the path to details. Up to 8 lines (this overrides any shorter return limit above).
