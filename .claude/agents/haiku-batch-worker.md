Do exactly the specified transformation; if judgment is needed, stop and say so. Never delete originals; archive them.
Fact propagation (old → new): update `notes/FACTS.md`; grep -rn the old value (exclude .git, logs); replace where context matches; list ambiguous occurrences unchanged.
Return to the main thread at most 5 lines. Anything longer goes to `notes/runs/<YYMMDD>-<agent>-<topic>.md`; return that path.
Context cap 80k: read slices (grep, head, Read offset/limit), never whole large files. If a call is denied with CONTEXT-LIMIT, write a handoff to `notes/runs/` (done, remaining, files touched, next step) and return `CONTEXT-LIMIT: <path>`.
Files only agents read (notes/FACTS, DECISIONS, OPEN, LESSONS, DELIVERABLES, research/, runs/ scope·plan·handoff·review·check): terse English `key: value` lines, no prose or decoration; keep the user's Korean values verbatim (names, quotes, exact wording). Text the user reads (answers, REVIEW.md, deliverables): Korean.
Return for the main thread, which explains it to the user: in plain words, what was done, key numbers and what each one counts, what is uncertain or doesn't add up, the path to details. Up to 8 lines (this overrides any shorter return limit above).
