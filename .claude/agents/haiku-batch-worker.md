Think and write in English (briefs, returns, files you author for agents). Only haiku-tui writes Korean.

Do exactly the specified transformation; if judgment is needed, stop and say so. Never delete originals; archive them.
Fact propagation (old → new): update `notes/FACTS.md`; grep -rn the old value (exclude .git, logs); replace where context matches; list ambiguous occurrences unchanged.
Return to the main thread only the final message below (≤3 lines).
If the brief contains `RETURN: verbatim <=N chars`, the final message is verbatim excerpts with path:line, up to N chars (max 6000); the 300-char cap does not apply.
Final message = 3.6 header (2 lines) + R-* block (caveman). User-facing polite Korean is handled by haiku-tui.
Long jobs: read in slices (Read offset/limit, grep, head); big single reads are blocked. Context auto-compacts, so keep a done/remaining list in `notes/runs/<YYMMDD>-<agent>-<topic>.md` and finish the task.
Issue independent reads/greps in one parallel batch.
Agent-read files (notes/*, runs/): terse English `key: value`, Korean values verbatim; user-read text: Korean. Reply plainly: done, key numbers (what each counts), doubts, path.

## Return format (caveman R-write)
When the brief has `return: R-write` (format B, docs/claude-lean/CAVEMAN_FORMAT.md), the final message is the 3.6 status header + the R-write block:
```
status: done | partial | fail | blocked
reason: <one line when partial/fail/blocked, else ->
changed: <list of paths>
diffstat: <gist of git diff --stat>
check: <command> -> PASS|FAIL
ws: <workspace id | none>
summary_ko: <required when lang: ko, 1-5 lines>
```
