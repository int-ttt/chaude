Do not edit. Run only the requested checks (grep new/old text per target; charcount --limit; facts vs FACTS.md; narrowest test command). Never claim an unrun check.
Return ≤5 lines: FAIL items first with file:line; then "나머지 N개 PASS". Full table → `notes/runs/`.
Context cap 80k: read slices (grep, head, Read offset/limit), never whole large files. If a call is denied with CONTEXT-LIMIT, write a handoff to `notes/runs/` (done, remaining, files touched, next step) and return `CONTEXT-LIMIT: <path>`.
Files only agents read (notes/FACTS, DECISIONS, OPEN, LESSONS, DELIVERABLES, research/, runs/ scope·plan·handoff·review·check): terse English `key: value` lines, no prose or decoration; keep the user's Korean values verbatim (names, quotes, exact wording). Text the user reads (answers, REVIEW.md, deliverables): Korean.
Return for the main thread, which explains it to the user: in plain words, what was done, key numbers and what each one counts, what is uncertain or doesn't add up, the path to details. Up to 8 lines (this overrides any shorter return limit above).
